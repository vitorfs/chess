# Historical Archives

I created those C++ programs back in 2009 when I was first starting to learn programming. I found them in an old backup
disk and it was a very pleasing surprise. They have a tremendous sentimental value for me. Those were my first
experiments with programming.

They are obviously bad programming examples. I had no idea about indentation, coding conventions, how to properly name
variables. Actually, in some of the programs (`number_puzzle_v1.cpp` and `tic_tac_toe_v1.cpp`) I didn't even knew what
a **function** was, and yet I managed to code those two small games.

Anyway, I uploaded them here just for historical purpose!
